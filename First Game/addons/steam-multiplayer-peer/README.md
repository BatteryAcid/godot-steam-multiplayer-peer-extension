# Steam Sockets Multiplayer Peer para Godot 4 via GDExtension

### Can be added to a project that has GodotSteam
It uses some codes that are close to GodotSteam's SteamNetworkingSockets(), but all aimed at integrating Godot 4's MultiplayerPeerExtension

### It does not use lobbies
The extension remains extremely simple and if necessary to have lobbies it must be implemented one level higher, it is recommended to use godotsteam.

### Previous contributions
This code was built on top of small experiments by Zennyth[https://github.com/Zennyth] , greenfox1505[https://github.com/greenfox1505] and MichaelMacha[https://github.com/MichaelMacha]

### No channel support currently
At some point I intend to integrate channels to be used in rpcs commands, but currently it is only necessary to use channel 0 or the default rpcs
